# Water is Life
I learn so much each time I finish a grow.  My goal is to evolve my indoor Grow Buddy solution to include this knowledge.  The focus on this evolution is water.  Getting the right amount of water working for me in a grow room is where I need the most help for now.  I'll focus on lighting and other aspects after I evolve water automation.  There are two water sources I wish to smartly automate: humidity and watering the soil (I grow indoors in Living Soil).  

# Managing Humidity



VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) and minimizing the chance for powdery mildew.  The last grow I had was outdoors.  Two of the plants got powdery mildew.  I spent many days searching and plucking out leaves.  Until we can get seeds with powdery mildew bread out, and even then! , my goal is to build an automated VPD system I'm calling VPD Buddy.  The environment will adjust to the three stages of growing - baby, vegetative, flower.
